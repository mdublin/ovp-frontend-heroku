#A few notes on the setup here:
#this __init__.py file is in the app directory, so app directory becomes a package

#because we have no global app object (the typical app object that is created in the global scope in simple Flask project, like app = Flask(__name__) ) we cannot use the typical @app.route('/) decorators on our views functions.  
#Instead we are using Blueprints. Blueprints are containers (objects) for routes, templates, or static files. 
#Those containers are inactive. The become active when they are "registered" with the application. If you do not register it, it does nothing. But once it is hooked up to the applicaiton, all the contents of the blueprint are automatically registered with the app in one go.

#becuase we do not have an app object that is a global object (instead app objects are created below in the app factory function create_app()) that we can pass to our instantiations of Flask extensions, we can create them here, unitialized becaue we are not passing anything to them. Then when you have app object you want, you complete the initialization of these extensions by calling .init_app(app)

    # main is a directory below (actually a package, becase it has an __init__.py file which contains the actual initialization of the main Blueprint object) where this current file lives, in app parent directory. So we are .main which is importing from the directory below the current file and
